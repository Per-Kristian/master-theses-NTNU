\todo{Future work: whenever the CA system locks out the user, let the PA system kick in earlier than usual to see if it agrees with the PA system.}
\todo{Score level fusion is less predictable than decision level fusion when it comes to adjusting parameters. More research is needed to find more predictable ways to adjust score level parameters.}
This is where you provide an overview of the thesis now that it is finished.  What are the critical things that can be learnt from the thesis for the reader.

This is additional text.
