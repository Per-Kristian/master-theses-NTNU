\chapter*{Preface}
This is a master's thesis written during the spring semester of 2018 to complete a master's degree in information security.
It documents a project that was conducted after being suggested as a research topic by Professor Patrick Bours, who also supervised the project.

The thesis dives into rather technical details surrounding keystroke dynamics.
Experts in biometrics are the target audience in mind.
However, I have attempted to write it in a way that is understandable and easy to follow for others who might also be interested.
This means that biometric terms and concepts are explained, but not to an extent that would bore the target audience.
Therefore, I hope that the reader will enjoy the work presented here, regardless of their background.
