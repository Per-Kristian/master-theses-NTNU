abstract="Information is increasingly in a digital-only format and almost everything we do nowadays depends on a digital identity for authentication and authorization. No matter how strong the authentication system is, after the authentication phase, there is no continuous verification that user is still the same human being that successfully logged in, thus leaving the system unprotected. This paper presents a usable breakthrough approach for continuous authentication with free typed text through the use of biometric techniques based on keystroke dynamics. Our main purpose is to achieve a reduction of the required sample size, while improving (or at least not worsen) precision performance, by adapting and improving parameters on a keystroke dynamics algorithm.",

abstract="A number of previous studies have investigated the use of keystroke analysis as a means of authenticating users' identities at the point of initial login. By contrast, relatively little research has focused upon the potential of applying the technique for identity verification during the logged-in session. Previous work by the authors has determined that keystroke analysis is a viable metric for continuous monitoring, provided that sufficient data is captured to create a reliable profile. This paper presents a series of results from a three-month trial in which profiles were created using digraph, trigraph and keyword-based keystroke latencies. The profiles were based upon a total of over 5 million keystroke samples, collected from 35 participants. The results demonstrate that the techniques offer significant promise as a means of non-intrusive identity verification during keyboard-related activities, with an optimum false acceptance rate of 4.9{\%} being observed at a rate of 0{\%} false rejection.",

The discussion also considers the use of keystroke analysis as a progressive, escalating response measure in the context of a comprehensive user authentication and supervision system, presenting an example of how this could be realised in practice.",

Their performances are reported before and after time interval histogram equalization, and the results corroborate with the hypothesis that the nonlinear memoryless time interval transform proposed here, despite its simplicity, can be a useful and almost costless building block in keystroke-based biometric systems."

abstract={Having a secure information system depends on successful authentication of legitimate users so as to prevent attacks from fraudulent persons. Traditional information security systems use a password or personal identification number (PIN). This means they can be easily accessed by unauthorized persons without access being noticed. This paper addresses the issue of enhancing such systems using keystroke biometrics as a translucent level of user authentication. The paper focuses on using the time interval (key down-down) between keystrokes as a feature of individuals' typing patterns to recognize authentic users and reject imposters. A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with a Back Propagation (BP) learning algorithm is used to train and validate the features. The results are compared with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network and several distance classifier method used in literature based on Equal Error Rate (EER).},

abstract={Most continuous user authentication techniques based on typing behavior rely on the keystroke dynamics or on the linguistic style of the user. However, there is a rich spectrum of cognition-centric behavioral traits that a typist exhibits during different stages of text production (e.g., composition, translation, and revision), which to our knowledge, have not been considered for continuous authentication. We study the continuous authentication performance of 123 behavioral traits extracted from discrete cognitive units called bursts. We performed experiments on typing data collected from 486 volunteer subjects. Our findings include: (1) features from bursts delimited by pause events have significantly higher availability and authentication performance compared to bursts delimited by revision events; (2) bursts with pause durations of at least one second provide the best authentication accuracy and availability; and (3) fusing our features with traditional keystroke dynamics features reduced authentication error rates. We achieved an equal error rate between 13.37 and 4.55 percent for authentication windows as low as 30 seconds to 3.5 minutes.},

abstract={The 2008 federal Higher Education Opportunity Act requires institutions of higher learning to make greater access control efforts for the purposes of assuring that students of record are those actually accessing the systems and taking exams in online courses by adopting identification technologies as they become more ubiquitous. To meet these needs, keystroke and stylometry biometrics were investigated towards developing a robust system to authenticate (verify) online test takers. Performance statistics on keystroke, stylometry, and combined keystroke-stylometry systems were obtained on data from 40 test-taking students enrolled in a university course. The best equal-error-rate performance on the keystroke system was 0.5\% which is an improvement over earlier reported results on this system. The performance of the stylometry system, however, was rather poor and did not boost the performance of the keystroke system, indicating that stylometry is not suitable for text lengths of short-answer tests unless the features can be substantially improved, at least for the method employed.},

abstract = "This paper introduces an approach for user authentication using free-text keystroke dynamics which incorporates the use of non-conventional keystroke features. Semi-timing features along with editing features are extracted from the user’s typing stream. Decision trees were exploited to classify each of the user’s data. In parallel for comparison, support vector machines (SVMs) were also used for classification in association with an ant colony optimization (ACO) feature selection technique. The results obtained from this study are encouraging as low false accept rates (FAR) and false reject rates (FRR) were achieved in the experimentation phase. This signifies that satisfactory overall system performance was achieved by using the typing attributes in the proposed approach. Thus, the use of non-conventional typing features improves the understanding of human typing behavior and therefore, provides significant contribution to the authentication system."

abstract = "The partially observable hidden Markov model is an extension of the hidden Markov Model in which the hidden state is conditioned on an independent Markov chain. This structure is motivated by the presence of discrete metadata, such as an event type, that may partially reveal the hidden state but itself emanates from a separate process. Such a scenario is encountered in keystroke dynamics whereby a user’s typing behavior is dependent on the text that is typed. Under the assumption that the user can be in either an active or passive state of typing, the keyboard key names are event types that partially reveal the hidden state due to the presence of relatively longer time intervals between words and sentences than between letters of a word. Using five public datasets, the proposed model is shown to consistently outperform other anomaly detectors, including the standard HMM, in biometric identification and verification tasks and is generally preferred over the HMM in a Monte Carlo goodness of fit test."

abstract={Keystroke dynamics-the analysis of typing rhythms to discriminate among users-has been proposed for detecting impostors (i.e., both insiders and external attackers). Since many anomaly-detection algorithms have been proposed for this task, it is natural to ask which are the top performers (e.g., to identify promising research directions). Unfortunately, we cannot conduct a sound comparison of detectors using the results in the literature because evaluation conditions are inconsistent across studies. Our objective is to collect a keystroke-dynamics data set, to develop a repeatable evaluation procedure, and to measure the performance of a range of detectors so that the results can be compared soundly. We collected data from 51 subjects typing 400 passwords each, and we implemented and evaluated 14 detectors from the keystroke-dynamics and pattern-recognition literature. The three top-performing detectors achieve equal-error rates between 9.6\% and 10.2\%. The results-along with the shared data and evaluation methodology-constitute a benchmark for comparing detectors and measuring progress.},
